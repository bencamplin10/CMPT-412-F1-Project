,,
24,To Valtteri Bottas,So critical stage. Anything you can do will gain for us later.
,,
24,To Daniel Ricciardo,"Alright Daniel good job. Next one Perez, Perez next car ahead."
,,
25,To Lewis Hamilton,"OK Lewis box, box."
,,
26,To Lewis Hamilton,OK Lewis so it’s going to be very close with Valtteri on exit.
,,
26,To Daniel Ricciardo,"OK so you are still quicker than the Force Indias who have pitted, they are on softs, you are quicker than them. You’re doing a great job."
,,
27,To Lewis Hamilton,"So if you can’t pull away from Valtteri, let him past, but I’ll just leave you to it."

,,
31,To Kevin Magnussen,Absolutely excellent pace.
,,
32,To Daniel Ricciardo,OK Daniel we’re going to be stopping very soon now. Everything you’ve got now. Going to be one or two laps.
,,
32,To Valtteri Bottas,Box box.
,,
33,To Kimi Raikkonen,"So Bottas is in, he will fall behind Sebastian as well."
,,
33,To Fernando Alonso,Stroll +0.9. Let’s push hard now. Magnussen close to the pit gap.
,,
33,From Fernando Alonso,"No power, no power."
33,To Fernando Alonso,"Power should recover. Keep pushing for the moment, we’re monitoring."
,,
33,To Daniel Ricciardo,"OK you’re going to be very close to Perez at pit exit. It’s going to be Magnussen, two Force Indias, going to be very close at pit exit let’s get stuck in."
,,
34,From Fernando Alonso,No power.
34,To Fernando Alonso,OK Fernando box now we need to retire.
,,
34,From Max Verstappen,Can he move out of the way?
36,To Daniel Ricciardo,"Nice job. Magnussen next, he’s on old softs, he has not stopped yet. Let’s get him."
,,
36,From Daniel Ricciardo,Who’s next?
36,To Daniel Ricciardo,"Next car ahead Hulkenberg, he can do 33.1s. Hulkenberg 11 seconds ahead of you."
,,
38,From Lewis Hamilton,Feels like these tyres are blistered.
38,To Daniel Ricciardo,You need everything you’ve got to catch Hulkenberg. You were half a second quicker than him before.
,,
39,To Daniel Ricciardo,"Last lap you took eight-tenths out of him, gap now 9.8."
,,
39,To Stoffel Vandoorne,"Cars ahead are fighting. There’s going to be opportunities, Stoff. Let’s get stuck in."
,,
40,To Daniel Ricciardo,OK that was another seven-tenths out of him. Gap now 9.2. You will need that level of push all the way to the end to catch him.
,,
41,To Nico Hulkenberg,OK Nico correction to lap count: 11 laps to go at the end of this lap.
,,
41,From Nico Hulkenberg,"Jesus, that’s not good, man."
42,From Max Verstappen,My left-front tyre is giving up. Can’t get the rotation in any more.
42,To Max Verstappen,"Understood, Max."
,,
42,From Nico Hulkenberg,I think I’ve got a blister on the front-right but it’s OK.
42,To Nico Hulkenberg,No problem Nico pace is good enough at the moment.
,,
42,To Daniel Ricciardo,"OK Daniel good stuff, that was another nine tenths, gap now 7.7. Keep pushing."
,,
43,To Nico Hulkenberg,"OK Nico, nine laps to go at the end of this lap. If you could find another couple of tenths it’d be really good."
,,
43,To Daniel Ricciardo,OK Daniel that’s another seven-tenths. Gap now seven seconds. I predict you’ll catch Hulkernberg two laps to go.
,,
44,To Max Verstappen,"Alright Max so the deal is Sebastian and Bottas are playing games at the moment. Bottas is trying to pass him. They’re through turn four. If we pit we’re unlikely to be able to capitalise anything. So unless you think we’re in any danger in terms of bringing this car home, at the moment we’ll stay out."
,,
44,From Max Verstappen,OK no worries.
44,To Valtteri Bottas,Good job.
,,
44,From Valtteri Bottas,Copy. Minimal talking.
45,From Sebastian Vettel,I have no more fronts. They’ve been blistering for 20 laps. I have zero front.
45,To Max Verstappen,Sebastian might be struggling ahead max with front tyres. I’ll keep you posted on his lap times. Don’t give up the fight just yet.
,,
46,From Romain Grosjean,"Mate he’s so stupid, unbelievable. I don’t know if he damaged the car or not."
47,To Kimi Raikkonen,OK so Bottas 6.5 behind. His last lap was 31.0. Obviously you had a blue.
,,
47,From Kimi Raikkonen,OK but put on the pit board the right numbers [censored by FOM] one-and-a-half seconds you show me all the time.
47,To Kimi Raikkonen,Understood.
,,
47,To Daniel Ricciardo,"There are six laps remaining, six laps to go, let’s get him."
,,
48,To Lance Stroll,"OK we have loss of aero, we can carry on."
,,
48,From Lance Stroll,OK but I’m just going to keep losing positions because I can’t go any quicker with the car the way it is.
48,To Daniel Ricciardo,OK that last lap nine-tenths quicker than him. Gap now 2.9. You’ll catch him two laps to go.
,,
49,From Nico Hulkenberg,I have de-rates. Why did I have so many de-rates on that straight?
49,To Nico Hulkenberg,"We have a problem, Nico. Just need to keep pushing."
,,
49,From Kimi Raikkonen,"[Censored by FOM] me my left-front tyre, it broke."
50,To Valtteri Bottas,"So two laps remaining there’s debris turn five to six, probably from Kimi, you’ve been through it already."
,,
50,From Max Verstappen,"Could’ve stayed out, there."
51,To Sebastian Vettel,"Puncture, puncture."
,,
51,To Nico Hulkenberg,Vettel is in trouble at turn ten.
,,
51,To Max Verstappen,Sebastian is turn nine and limping home.
,,
51,From Max Verstappen,"Check my left-hand tyres, I had to overtake on the debris."
51,To Max Verstappen,All OK at the moment.
,,

VL,From Kimi Raikkonen,So we never seem to have any single luck. [Censored by FOM] joke.
VL,To Valtteri Bottas,"Great job Valtteri, really god job. Well driven, well-managed. Brilliant."
,,
VL,From Valtteri Bottas,Yes guys! Told you it’s possible. Never give up.
VL,To Valtteri Bottas,Exactly. Never give up.
,,
VL,To Max Verstappen,OK that is P4 today Max. Nice job mate.
,,
VL,To Max Verstappen,That’s a good drive Max. We changed the tyres at the end there just because of what happened with Sebastian. You were right on the limit as well. So well done you got your elbows out and gave it everything you could.
,,
VL,From Max Verstappen,Yeah I at least tried. So not too bad.
VL,To Max Verstappen,It was definitely entertaining and you got to see the chequered flag.
,,
VL,From Max Verstappen,Exactly.
VL,From Lewis Hamilton,"What can I say about these fans? We’ve got the best fans here. Thank you everyone that turned up. I see you out there! Thank you, God bless you."

VL,To Daniel Ricciardo,"Well done Daniel, great drive. You did it twice, well done."
,,
VL,From Daniel Ricciardo,"Yeah, I made work for myself."
VL,From Sebastian Vettel,Well there was no sign of that happening. Sorry. I had vibrations but I had it for like 20 laps. It didn’t get massively worse. The tyres didn’t look good but they never look good.
VL,To Sebastian Vettel,From our side it was instantaneous.
,,
VL,To Esteban Ocon,Good job mate.
,,
VL,From Esteban Ocon,Good job.
VL,To Esteban Ocon,Nice one.
,,
VL,To Stoffel Vandoorne,"Stoff we’re P11. That was a great drive, really close, bit frustrating but I think you’ve done a really good job, good driving today."
,,
VL,From Stoffel Vandoorne,"Yeah, shame, no points. I tried the maximum. It’s a shame we lost a little bit of time with the pit stop."
VL,To Stoffel Vandoorne,Yeah pace was very strong.
,,
VL,To Marcus Ericsson,OK Marcus that’s it. P14. But was a good second stint.
,,
VL,From Marcus Ericsson,"Thank you, thanks guys."
